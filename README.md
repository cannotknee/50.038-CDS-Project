# HDB Resale Flat Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project explores the use of machine learning algorithms to predict Housing Development Board (HDB) resale flat prices in Singapore. The accurate prediction of resale flat prices is crucial in enabling informed decisions for buyers and sellers.
## Data Collection and Preprocessing

The HDB resale flat dataset was obtained from the HDB website. The data was preprocessed by conducting feature engineering and additional data preprocessing.
## Algorithms Used

Three algorithms were used in this project:

    1. Random Forest
    2. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Recurrent Neural Network
    3. eXtreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)

## Code structure
The final 3 timeseries models are in the root of the folder.<br>
Random Forest Time Series Model: RandomForest_TimeSeries.ipynb<br>
LSTM Time Series Model: RandomForest_TimeSeries.ipynb<br>
XGBoost Time Series Model: XGBoost_TimeSeries.ipynb<br>

The scripts used to clean the data can be found in the "01_cleaning_data" folder.<br>
The inital naive models use and other models experimented can be found in "02_intial_naive_models" folder.<br>
The dataset can be found in the "data" folder.<br>
